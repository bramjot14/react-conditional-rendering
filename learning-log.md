React Conditional Rendering

Completed:
- Practiced conditional rendering in React using:
- Ternary operator (condition ? A : B)
- Logical AND operator (condition && A)
- Controlled UI rendering based on application state
- Passed state as props to child components
- Dynamically changed button text and form fields
- Improved understanding of when to use ternary vs AND rendering
- Built a clean, minimal practice project to reinforce concepts

Key Takeaway:
Conditional rendering allows React apps to stay dynamic and responsive without unnecessary components or routes.
